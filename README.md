# Chess-openings-app-project

This app allows you to practice various chess openings. You can play both as white or black, ask for a hint as to what the next move should be and add openings on your own. The app was written using mainly tkinter, PySimpleGUI and python-chess library.

**To use the app, for the time being, download all the files, open them in your favourite IDE (recommended PyCharm) and start file 'menu.py'. In future, if it finally works, it will be available as app (via Pyinstaller or something similar, but they have been resistant to cooperation so far...).

**Requirements: 
tkinter 
playsound 
chess 
PySimpleGUI
PIL
time

threading
os
sys

** dodane w trakcie zajec, ale to tylko dowod ze uwaznie slucham **
